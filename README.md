# Path-Creator

## Installation

Add the following path to dependencies in your manifest to install through [UPM](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-manager-ui@1.8/manual/index.html)
    
```json
"dependencies": {
    "com.seblague.pathcreator": "https://github.com/hannesdelbeke/Path-Creator.git?path=/Path%20Creator%20Project/Assets/PathCreator/Core",  
}
```

repo is: `https://github.com/hannesdelbeke/Path-Creator.git`

sub directory is: `Path%20Creator%20Project/Assets/PathCreator/Core`

## Repo setup 

To easily stay in sync with the original repo,

The package.json file is in a sub directory, in the core folder. Instead of at the repo root.

It includes only the essential files, and does not install the examples and documentation.pdf

## Requirements

You need a unity version that supports sub directories in the github repo path

Tested on Unity 2019.3.14f1.
